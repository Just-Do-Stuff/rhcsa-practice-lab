# Repository Structure Guide

Each exam category folder contains:
```
01-understand-essential-tools/
├── README.md
├── task1/
│   ├── instructions.md
│   └── answer.md
└── task2/
    ├── instructions.md
    └── answer.md
```

### Folder Naming
Each category begins with a two-digit prefix for ordering, followed by the objective title in lowercase and hyphenated form.

### Task Files
- **instructions.md** — Describes the problem or exam scenario.
- **answer.md** — Contains correct syntax/output (beginner-focused, no extra commentary).

### Contribution Notes
- Follow naming patterns.
- Use clear, reproducible examples.
- Keep tasks within RHCSA scope.
