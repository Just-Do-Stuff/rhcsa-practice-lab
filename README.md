# RHCSA Practice Lab 


## 🔍 Purpose
This repository provides hands-on, exam-style exercises for each RHCSA objective. It’s designed to help learners practice tasks aligned with real-world system administration scenarios.

Each objective includes:
- 2 exam-style **tasks** (`instructions.md`)
- Corresponding **answers** (`answer.md`)
- Organized folders by **exam category**


# IMPORTANT! 
### It is ok if you get stuck on a task. That is where growth is. Use the *'man' pages* to find the answer. DO NOT USE CHATGPT. CHATGPT will *NOT* be there for you on the exam.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Just-Do-Stuff/rhcsa-practice-lab.git
